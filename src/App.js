           Alice is new to rock climbing and wants to document her progress.
           For each climb, she documents the following:
           The professional rated difficulty of the climb (V0-V10)
           Her personal rating of the difficulty of the climb
           Her strategy and thoughts about the climb
           Whether she completed or failed the climb

          She also records her climbs on her phone and her session time

          Alice finds that her notes are confusing at times, and it is tedious to try
          to match her notes to her recordings, which are stored in a separate application
          (camera roll.) She wants a way to do all of these things on her phone, but
          store the documented data in one place, and organized by each session.
