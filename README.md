            Alice is new to rock climbing and wants to document her progress.
            For each climb, she documents the following:
          </p>
            <ol className="ml-12 my-4 list-decimal">
              <li>
                The professional rated difficulty of the climb (V0-V10)
              </li>
           
              <li>
                Her personal rating of the difficulty of the climb
              </li>
            
              <li>
                Her strategy and thoughts about the climb
              </li>
            
              <li>
                Whether she completed or failed the climb
              </li>
            </ol>
          
          Alice also records her climbs on her phone and her session time
          <br/>
          Alice finds that her notes are confusing at times, and it is tedious to try
          to match her notes to her recordings, which are stored in her camera roll. 
          The redundance of searching through her notes and matching it with a video is
          discouraging her from documenting her progress.
          She wants a way to do all of these things on her phone, and in one place. 
          Each documentation should be ordered by session.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
